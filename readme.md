This project is named Odin Recipes.
The goal of the project is to create a basic "brutal" website using only html & the concepts covered there-in by The Odin Project(T.O.P). 
I will be creating a basic website which will include html boilerplate for 
encoding,display and language. 
Later in the Odin course I will be returning to this project to add CSS.
