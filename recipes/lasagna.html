    <h2><strong>The Savory History of Lasagna</strong></h2>
    <p>
      When was lasagna invented? The Italian favorite of lasagne or lasagna that
      we all know and love originated in Italy in the city of Naples during the
      Middle Ages. One of the first references to modern-day lasagne can be
      found in a 14th-century English cookbook that highlighted a dish with
      layers of pasta without the tomatoes. Later, another reference was made to
      lasagne in an Italian cookbook in the 1880s that featured tomato sauce.

      The dish eventually evolved into the traditional lasagna of Naples called
      eme<em>“Lasagna di Carnevale”</em> made with local sausage, fried
      meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta or mozzarella, and Neapolitan Ragu.
      One of the most popular variations of this lasagna dish is called
      <em>“Lasagna al Forno.”</em> This variation originates from the Italian
      region of Emilia-Romagna and is made with ricotta or mozzarella, thick
      Ragu, bechamel sauce, wine, onion, oregano, and green sheets of pasta made
      with spinach. Lasagne’s history wouldn’t be complete without variety
      throughout the regions of Italy. Different areas may use different dough
      or sauces. The beautiful Italian region of Piedmont specializes in lasagna
      al Sangue, which translates to <em>“bloody lasagne”</em> due to the
      addition of blood from a slaughtered pig.
