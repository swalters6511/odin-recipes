    <h2><strong>The Savory History of Steak</strong></h2>
    <p>
      The word steak may sound like an American culinary dish, but it actually
      originated and became popular in Florence, Italy way back mid 15th century
      Scandinavian. So basically, the country where steak comes from is Italy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aside from Italy, there are also countries that have a culinary use of
      steak and a history of production. Ireland, Argentina, Australia, United
      States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand are among these countries. These
      countries usually have suitable land grazing animals, specifically cattle.

    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 strip steaks (each about 1 inch thick), room temperature.</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
      <br>
      <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>
      <br>
      <li>Simple Steak Sauce, optional</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet (preferably cast iron) over high 5
        minutes. Generously season steaks with salt and pepper. Add 1/2 teaspoon
        butter to pan, then immediately top with one steak. Repeat with
        remaining 1/2 teaspoon butter and steak. Cook without moving steaks
        until a golden brown crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn and cook 2
        minutes more for rare, or 3 to 4 minutes more for medium-rare. Transfer
        to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes. Slice steaks against the
        grain; serve with sauce, if desired.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat a 10- or 12-inch cast-iron skillet over high heat. Season the
        steaks liberally with salt and pepper. Seconds before adding a steak,
        drop 1/2 teaspoon of the butter into the pan and immediately top with
        the steak. Repeat with the remaining steak. Sear for 3 minutes without
        moving the steak (to form a crust). Turn and cook for 2 minutes for rare
        or 3 to 4 for medium rare. Remove the steaks from the pan and let them
        rest on a board or platter for a few minutes before serving.
